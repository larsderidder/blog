I’m planning to write a series of posts about what I perceive to be essential soft skills for any Software Engineer, regardless of exact position or occupation. Whether you’re a junior Software Engineer or senior architect, there are some things you should learn to be able to do well to most effectively do what you’re really paid for; writing code.

This post is aimed at the basics. I’m planning to go more in depth about other subjects in future posts.

## Speak up

We engineers are a timid bunch. Put us behind a computer and we work magic, but put us in a room full of people, and we quietly nod when the project managers ask us if we can deliver three new features by next week.

You have to realize that, whatever your level or experience, you hold a certain power, far greater than those fast-talking executives. That is the power of creation. You are able to make things real, to build things and change the course of a company (for better or worse) with every line of code you write. Now I’m sure all those other people look very impressive, but when it comes down to it, they’re all grasping in the dark about a subject you are intimately familiar with: your code. Whether they admit it or not, they need your help.

You also have a responsibility to yourself to speak up. You have to protect yourself, and cover your proverbial ass. While it sounds heroic to work nights and weekends to get the release done in time, it’s really no fun for anyone involved. Or rather, it’s no fun when it is forced upon you. If you want to do it then that’s fine, but make sure it’s on your own terms.

So speak up. Tell them that it is impossible to make that deadline, or that you can’t start the next project as the current one isn’t done yet. Or, on a more positive note, tell them how they can add another feature to the release by only two lines of code that they considered would take another month. They’ll love you for it, both for the good and for the bad, and they'll keep you near in future projects because of it. But let them take some of the credit, they need that sometimes.

Now, this is very hard to do in a meeting however. Effective communication in a meeting is a whole different topic. So if that isn't possible for you, then don't. Simply don't make commitments during the meeting. Postpone the decision, and say you need some time to think about it, or that you need to investigate something first. This is usually no big deal and everyone will understand, because while they don't know what you do exactly, they do know it's hard. Afterwards, think about it for a bit, and send an email or speak to the relevant people privately. This makes it much easier to convey your ideas.

A small footnote: If you do speak up and get barked at, it’s probably time to think about looking for another job.

## Disagree with your intellect, not with your emotions

I considered writing some header about using your head instead of your heart, but that sounded a little too cheesy.

<img src="/assets/logicvsemotion.jpg" alt="Logic vs emotion" class="center" style="width: 50%;" />

Engineers often feel very strongly about their opinions and preferences. So strongly, that arguments have a tendency to become emotional. Never let this happen, as there’s nothing emotional about these arguments. Emotional arguments only make sense with people you have an actual emotional relationship with, such as a girlfriend or (if you're like me) your cat. Not with a colleague.

Enter every argument with the idea that you are quite possibly wrong. Depending on the other person, this might even be quite likely. So don’t get married to your opinion, and distance yourself from it mentally. Changing your mind should be a cheap operation.

Start by considering the other person. Is he an idiot? If he is, why is he working with you (or why are you working with him)? If he’s not, he probably has a reason for his point of view. Is he more senior than you? Then you’re probably wrong, so put yourself in the shoes of the apprentice and start learning.

Thoroughly figure out his point of view. What is his actual opinion? How does it differ from yours? Where is it similar or even the same? How did he get to this opinion? Does he have information that you don't have, or vice versa?

Discuss his reasons for having this specific opinion. Why did he reach this conclusion, given that you both have the same information? Can you understand why that is? If not, ask more questions and clarifications. Or does he simply consider other things to be more important than you do, and are you not so much disagreeing about the issue, but rather about the priority given to various aspects of the issue (for example performance vs maintainability)?

Finally, after making sure both of you thoroughly understand each other but neither has changed his mind (or you both changed your mind, it happens), consider how important this issue is. If it's not, consider yielding to the other. You can't win every battle, and yielding should be not so difficult now that you understand his reasoning. If you feel it is still important, either pull in more brains or find a referee to make the call. But do this together, as at this point you should both be on the way to find the right way forward, instead of figuring out who's right.

A very important side effect of all this is that you will learn much faster. You already know about your own opinion and how you yourself approach problems, there's not so much to learn there. Others however are a big mystery. Dive into their points of view and their way of thinking and you’ll grow much faster than you can do by yourself.

## Be positive and constructive in your feedback

I’m not sure what it is with engineers, but we are a snarky bunch. We like to point out issues in other people’s work, often in front of others. After all, it was kind of obvious that they should have checked on unicode characters in the input, right?

The thing is, it’s often not that simple. In retrospect everything is easy. But perhaps he was actually planning to fix that glaring bug, when someone interrupted him because of an issue on production, or to “take a quick look” at something which ended up taking the rest of the day. Or he was in the middle of crunch time and wrote this code at midnight in a caffeine induced high. Or he was just lazy and incompetent.

Whatever the reason however, ridiculing the other will not help him. Negative feedback works demotivating and alienating; repeat it often enough and he will stop trying and won’t ask for help anymore, and the best case outcome then is that he simply leaves the company. But that isn't exactly a great outcome.

If you have this problem, the first step is recognition. Think about how you give feedback. How often do you point out the good, and how often the bad? What is the outcome of your feedback? Does it help? Do you see progress? If not, it's time for a change.

If you see a mistake, avoid mentioning it in public. Talk to the person in private. Tell him about it, and if you feel like he needs help with it, find out what happened and why. See if you can think of ways to avoid it in the future. Link him to a relevant article, or plan a pair programming session. Be constructive in your feedback, and praise them for every step of progress.

## To conclude

So we've talked about speaking up, disagreeing and debating based on logic instead of emotions and being positive and constructive when giving feedback. This should give you the ability to influence decisions regarding the code you’re writing, and helps you to create a constructive and positive work environment.

If you manage to get this down consistently, you're suddenly not "just" a guy who only writes code. Rather, you'll become a serious asset to your company. You'll be involved in more projects, because all the project managers want you around to make their lives easier. And because of your attitude, you’ll be able to learn and grow much faster than other engineers who consistently stick to their opinions. Whatever your goal in your career, these things will help you out in the long run.
