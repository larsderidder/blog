I'm a software engineer turned product manager turned software engineering manager. I love to create and to grow both people and products. When I'm not doing that, I prefer to be left alone and travel and/or hike with my lovely girlfriend, work in my garden or just lounge on my couch with my laptop and cats on my lap, or my rabbits playing around my feet.

I started writing because I realized that I come up with all kinds of ideas and insights, some useful and others not, but I don't always do something with them. So I figured, let's write them down. At the worst it's finger practice (and I'm sure I'll find a survival-related reason for typing fast someday), and at best someone out there who could benefit.

If you want to contact me about something I've written, go ahead, but I'm not guaranteeing a response.
