I'm a software engineer turned product manager turned software engineering manager. I love to create and to grow both people and products. When I'm not doing that, I prefer to be left alone and travel and/or hike with my lovely girlfriend, work in my garden or just lounge on my couch with my laptop and cats on my lap, or my rabbits playing around my feet.

I started writing because I realized that I come up with all kinds of ideas and insights, some useful and others not, but I don't always do something with them. So I figured, let's write them down. At the worst it's finger practice (and I'm sure I'll find a survival-related reason for typing fast someday), and at best someone out there who could benefit.

And while you can find the source of this blog on Github, I might as well go ahead and satisfy your curiosity. It's written in the Markdown syntax and generated by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go. I use a modified Lanyon theme.
